# Stock Market Trend Prediction Web App

**Introduction**

This project is a web application designed to assist users in analyzing historical stock trends, visualizing data, and leveraging machine learning models to potentially make more informed investment decisions.

**Objective**

The primary goal is to empower users with an interactive platform for the following:

* **Exploring historical stock data:** Gain insights into past trends and patterns.
* **Visualizing data:** Generate insightful charts and graphs using powerful libraries.
* **Machine learning-based price prediction:** Utilize trained models to make predictions (remember, predictions are not guarantees).

**Technical Stack**

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
    * Streamlit (User Interface)
    * NumPy & pandas (Data Manipulation)
    * Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
    * TensorFlow/Keras (Machine Learning)
    * yfinance (Data Fetching)

**Functionality**

1. **User Input:** Enter a stock ticker symbol to retrieve historical data from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Data Analysis:** Generate descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
3. **Data Visualization:** Create informative charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line plots) to illustrate trends and patterns.
4. **Machine Learning Model Prediction (Optional):**
    * A trained recurrent neural network (RNN) model built using TensorFlow/Keras can be used to predict future stock prices.
    * Data is preprocessed using MinMaxScaler for feature scaling.
    * **Disclaimer:** Predicted prices are estimates and should not be solely relied upon for investment decisions.
    * **Visualization:** Predicted prices are compared with actual prices for comparison.

**Project Limitations and Risks**

* **Market Volatility:** Stock prices are inherently volatile, making accurate predictions challenging.
* **Economic Factors:** External events and economic conditions can significantly impact stock prices.
* **Data Limitations:** Prediction accuracy may be affected by data quality and availability.
* **Behavioral Biases:** Investor sentiment and behavior can influence stock market movements, adding complexity to prediction models.

**Conclusion**

This web application provides a valuable tool for users to analyze historical stock data, explore trends, and potentially gain insights for formulating informed investment decisions. However, it's crucial to remember that predictions are not guarantees, and various factors can influence stock market behavior.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python (version 3.x recommended) and the required libraries installed (refer to `requirements.txt` for details).
2. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-app.git` (replace with your repository URL).
3. **Installation:** Navigate to the project directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
4. **Run the App:** Execute `streamlit run app.py` to launch the application in your web browser.

**Additional Notes**

* Consider including a `requirements.txt` file to list all necessary libraries and their versions for easy setup.
